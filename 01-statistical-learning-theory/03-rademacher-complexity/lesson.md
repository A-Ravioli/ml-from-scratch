## Prerequisites

- VC dimension theory
- Probability theory (concentration inequalities)
- Functional analysis (suprema of stochastic processes)

## Learning Objectives

- Master Rademacher complexity and its applications
- Understand empirical process theory fundamentals
- Connect complexity measures to generalization bounds
- Apply to modern machine learning algorithms

## Mathematical Foundations

### 1. Rademacher Random Variables

#### Definition 1.1 (Rademacher Variables)

σᵢ are independent random variables with P(σᵢ = +1) = P(σᵢ = -1) = 1/2.

These model "random signs" and are fundamental to empirical process theory.

#### Properties

- E[σᵢ] = 0
- Var(σᵢ) = 1
- E[σᵢσⱼ] = 0 for i ≠ j
- Sub-Gaussian with parameter 1

### 2. Empirical Rademacher Complexity

#### Definition 2.1 (Empirical Rademacher Complexity)

For function class ℱ and sample S = {x₁, ..., xₘ}:

ℛₛ(ℱ) = E_σ[sup_{f∈ℱ} (1/m) ∑ᵢ₌₁ᵐ σᵢf(xᵢ)]

where expectation is over Rademacher variables σ = (σ₁, ..., σₘ).

#### Intuition

- Measures correlation between functions and random noise
- If ℱ can fit random labels, it's complex
- If no function correlates with noise, ℱ is simple

#### Definition 2.2 (Rademacher Complexity)

ℛₘ(ℱ) = E_S[ℛₛ(ℱ)]

where expectation is over random samples S.

### 3. Basic Properties

#### Theorem 3.1 (Basic Properties)

1. **Monotonicity**: ℱ₁ ⊆ ℱ₂ ⟹ ℛₘ(ℱ₁) ≤ ℛₘ(ℱ₂)
2. **Convexity**: ℛₘ(conv(ℱ)) = ℛₘ(ℱ)
3. **Scaling**: ℛₘ(cℱ) = |c|ℛₘ(ℱ)
4. **Translation invariance**: ℛₘ(ℱ + c) = ℛₘ(ℱ)

#### Theorem 3.2 (Symmetrization)

For any function class ℱ:
E_S[sup_{f∈ℱ} |𝔼[f] - 𝔼_S[f]|] ≤ 2ℛₘ(ℱ)

This connects empirical process fluctuations to Rademacher complexity.

### 4. Generalization Bounds

#### Theorem 4.1 (Rademacher Generalization Bound)

With probability ≥ 1 - δ, for all f ∈ ℱ:

R(f) ≤ R̂(f) + 2ℛₘ(ℱ) + √(log(2/δ)/(2m))

**Proof Sketch**:

1. Use symmetrization to relate generalization gap to empirical process
2. Apply concentration inequality (McDiarmid's inequality)
3. Bound empirical process using Rademacher complexity □

#### Comparison with VC Bounds

- **VC bound**: √(d log(m)/m) where d = VCdim(ℱ)
- **Rademacher bound**: 2ℛₘ(ℱ)
- Rademacher can be tighter for specific problems/distributions

### 5. Computing Rademacher Complexity

#### Linear Functions

For ℱ = {x ↦ w·x : ||w|| ≤ B}:
ℛₘ(ℱ) = (B/m) E[||∑ᵢ σᵢxᵢ||]

If ||xᵢ|| ≤ R, then ℛₘ(ℱ) ≤ BR/√m.

#### Theorem 5.1 (Massart's Lemma)

For finite set 𝒜 ⊂ ℝᵐ:
E_σ[sup_{a∈𝒜} ∑ᵢ σᵢaᵢ] ≤ √(2 log|𝒜|) sup_{a∈𝒜} ||a||₂

This gives Rademacher complexity for finite function classes.

#### Neural Networks

For L-layer networks with weights bounded by B:
ℛₘ(ℱ) ≤ (B^L R)/√m × √(∏ᵢ nᵢ)

where nᵢ is width of layer i and R bounds input norm.

### 6. Concentration and Chaining

#### Definition 6.1 (Gaussian Width)

w(𝒜) = E_g[sup_{a∈𝒜} ⟨g, a⟩]

where g ~ N(0, I).

#### Theorem 6.1 (Comparison Inequality)

For any set 𝒜:
E_σ[sup_{a∈𝒜} ⟨σ, a⟩] ≤ √(π/2) w(𝒜)

#### Dudley's Chaining

For metric space (𝒯, d) and γ > 0:
E[sup_{t∈𝒯} X_t] ≤ 12 ∫₀^∞ √(log 𝒩(ε, 𝒯, d)) dε

where 𝒩(ε, 𝒯, d) is covering number.

### 7. Algorithmic Stability Connection

#### Definition 7.1 (Uniform Stability)

Algorithm 𝒜 has uniform stability β if for all datasets S, S':
|ℓ(𝒜(S), z) - ℓ(𝒜(S'), z)| ≤ β

where S, S' differ in one example.

#### Theorem 7.1 (Stability-Rademacher Connection)

If algorithm has stability β, then:
ℛₘ(ℱ_𝒜) ≤ β

where ℱ_𝒜 is the class of functions the algorithm can output.

### 8. Practical Applications

#### Support Vector Machines

For SVM with margin γ:
ℛₘ(ℱ_SVM) ≤ R/√(mγ²)

This explains why large margin helps generalization.

#### Deep Networks

Modern bounds for deep networks often use:

- Path norms instead of weight norms
- Spectral norms of weight matrices
- Compression-based arguments

#### Kernel Methods

For RKHS with kernel k:
ℛₘ(ℱ_k) ≤ √(tr(K)/m)

where K is kernel matrix.

### 9. Local Rademacher Complexity

#### Definition 9.1 (Local Complexity)

For r > 0:
ℛₘ(ℱ, r) = E_S[ℛₛ(ℱ ∩ B(f̂, r))]

where f̂ is empirical minimizer and B(f̂, r) is ball of radius r.

#### Localization Lemma

If functions are bounded, then with high probability:
R(f̂) - R(f*) ≤ inf_{r>0} [ℛₘ(ℱ, r) + r]

This can give faster rates when complexity decreases locally.

### 10. Advanced Topics
