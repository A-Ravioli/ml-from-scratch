## learning philosophy

1. **first principles**: derive everything from mathematical foundations
2. **implementation first**: code before using libraries
3. **theory â†” practice**: connect mathematical insights to empirical results
4. **research mindset**: question assumptions, propose extensions

## how to use this curriculum

1. **follow the order**: topics build on each other systematically
2. **complete exercises**: implementation is crucial for understanding
3. **read papers**: each lesson connects to research literature
4. **test understanding**: answer socratic questions before moving on
5. **build projects**: apply knowledge to increasingly complex problems
