## Mathematical Foundations

### 1. The Infinite-Width Limit

#### Motivation
What happens when neural network width → ∞?

**Intuition**: 
- Infinite parameters → Central Limit Theorem applies
- Network functions become Gaussian processes
- Training dynamics become linear

#### Historical Context
- **1988**: Radford Neal shows single hidden layer → GP
- **2018**: Jacot et al. extend to arbitrary depth
- **2019-present**: Explosion of theoretical work

### 2. From Neural Networks to Gaussian Processes

#### Single Hidden Layer Case
Consider network: f(x; θ) = ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ aᵢσ(wᵢᵀx + bᵢ)

**Scaling**: aᵢ ~ N(0, 1/n), wᵢ ~ N(0, Σw), bᵢ ~ N(0, σb²)

#### Theorem 2.1 (Neal 1996)
As n → ∞, the function f(x; θ) converges to a Gaussian process:
f(x) ~ GP(0, K^(1)(x, x'))

where K^(1)(x, x') = E[σ(w^T x + b)σ(w^T x' + b)]

#### Multi-Layer Extension
For L-layer network with widths n₁, ..., nₗ → ∞:

**Recursive kernel construction**:
K^(0)(x, x') = (1/d)x^T x'
K^(ℓ)(x, x') = σ²w E[σ(u)σ(v)] + σ²b

where (u, v) ~ N(0, [K^(ℓ-1)(x,x), K^(ℓ-1)(x,x'); K^(ℓ-1)(x',x), K^(ℓ-1)(x',x')])

### 3. Neural Tangent Kernel Theory

#### The Training Process
Consider gradient descent on network f(x; θ(t)):
dθ/dt = -η∇θL(θ)

where L(θ) = (1/2)∑ᵢ(f(xᵢ; θ) - yᵢ)²

#### Function Evolution
df(x; θ(t))/dt = ∇θf(x; θ(t))^T dθ/dt
                = -η∇θf(x; θ(t))^T ∇θL(θ)

#### Definition 3.1 (Neural Tangent Kernel)
The Neural Tangent Kernel at initialization is:
K^NTK(x, x') = E[∇θf(x; θ(0)) · ∇θf(x'; θ(0))]

where θ(0) is random initialization.

#### Theorem 3.1 (Jacot et al. 2018)
In the infinite width limit, the NTK remains constant during training:
K^NTK(x, x'; t) = K^NTK(x, x'; 0) = K^NTK(x, x')

#### Training Dynamics in NTK Regime
The function evolution becomes:
df(x; t)/dt = -η∫ K^NTK(x, x')(f(x'; t) - y(x'))dx'

For discrete training points {x₁, ..., xₙ}:
df/dt = -ηK(f - y)

where K_ij = K^NTK(xᵢ, xⱼ).

#### Solution
f(t) = f(0) + (I - e^(-ηKt))(y - f(0))

**Key insight**: Training is linear in function space!

### 4. NTK Computation

#### Recursive Formula for Fully Connected Networks
For L-layer network:

**Base case** (input layer):
Σ^(0)(x, x') = x^T x'
Θ^(0)(x, x') = Σ^(0)(x, x')

**Recursive step** (ℓ = 1, ..., L-1):
Σ^(ℓ)(x, x') = σ²w E[σ(u)σ(v)] + σ²b
Θ^(ℓ)(x, x') = Σ^(ℓ)(x, x') · E[σ'(u)σ'(v)] + Θ^(ℓ-1)(x, x') · E[σ(u)σ(v)]

where (u, v) ~ N(0, [Σ^(ℓ-1)(x,x), Σ^(ℓ-1)(x,x'); Σ^(ℓ-1)(x',x), Σ^(ℓ-1)(x',x')])

**Final NTK**: K^NTK(x, x') = Θ^(L-1)(x, x')

#### Activation-Specific Formulas

**ReLU activation**: σ(z) = max(0, z)
For (u, v) ~ N(0, [a, c; c, b]):
E[σ(u)σ(v)] = (1/2π)√(ab)[sin(θ) + (π - θ)cos(θ)]
E[σ'(u)σ'(v)] = (1/2π)(π - θ)

where θ = arccos(c/√(ab))

**Erf activation**: σ(z) = erf(z/√2)
E[σ(u)σ(v)] = (2/π)arcsin(2c/√((1+2a)(1+2b)))

### 5. Theoretical Properties

#### Global Convergence
**Theorem 5.1**: In the NTK regime, gradient descent achieves global minimum if K^NTK is positive definite.

**Proof sketch**: Linear dynamics with positive definite kernel guarantee convergence.

#### Generalization
**Theorem 5.2**: NTK regression has generalization bound:
E[L(f)] ≤ L(f̂) + √(tr(K^NTK)/n)

where f̂ is the trained function.

#### Spectral Properties
- **Eigenvalues**: Determine convergence rates of different modes
- **Condition number**: Affects optimization difficulty
- **Rank**: Effective dimensionality of function space

### 6. Finite vs Infinite Width

#### Feature Learning
**Infinite width**: No feature learning (kernel regime)
**Finite width**: Features evolve during training

#### Theorem 6.1 (Chizat et al. 2019)
For finite but large width n:
||K^NTK(t) - K^NTK(0)|| = O(1/√n)

So finite networks approximately follow NTK dynamics.

#### When Does NTK Theory Apply?
**Good approximation**:
- Very wide networks (width ≫ 1000)
- Small learning rates
- Short training times
- Simple tasks

**Poor approximation**:
- Standard width networks
- Large learning rates
- Long training (feature learning regime)
- Complex tasks requiring representation learning

### 7. Extensions and Variants

#### Convolutional Neural Tangent Kernel (CNTK)
For CNNs, the NTK has additional structure:
- **Translation equivariance**: K(x, x') depends on x - x'
- **Hierarchical features**: Multi-scale representations
- **Local connectivity**: Sparse kernel structure

#### Recurrent Neural Tangent Kernel (RNTK)
For RNNs processing sequences:
- **Temporal dependencies**: Kernel depends on sequence position
- **Memory effects**: Long-range correlations
- **Stability conditions**: For bounded sequences

#### Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK)
For GNNs on graphs:
- **Permutation invariance**: Kernel respects graph symmetries
- **Message passing**: Information propagation in kernel
- **Graph-dependent**: Kernel structure follows graph topology

### 8. Computational Aspects

#### Exact NTK Computation
**Complexity**: O(n²d) for n samples, d dimensions
**Memory**: O(n²) for storing kernel matrix

**Algorithm 8.1 (NTK Computation)**:
```python
def compute_ntk(X1, X2, params):
    # Recursive computation of Σ and Θ
    for layer in range(depth):
        Sigma = compute_sigma(Sigma_prev, params[layer])
        Theta = compute_theta(Theta_prev, Sigma, params[layer])
    return Theta
```

#### Efficient Approximations
**Random features**: Approximate kernel with finite random features
**Low-rank**: Use eigendecomposition for large kernels
**Hierarchical**: Exploit structure in CNN/RNN kernels

#### Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP)
Related to NTK, NNGP library provides efficient implementations:
- **Automatic differentiation**: For complex architectures
- **GPU acceleration**: For large-scale problems
- **Stochastic estimation**: For very large datasets

### 9. Empirical Studies and Validation

#### Experimental Validation
1. **Width scaling**: Compare networks of increasing width
2. **Learning rate**: Very small rates approach NTK limit

### 10. Connection to Other Theories

#### Mean Field Theory
In the infinite width limit:
- **Weights**: Remain close to initialization
- **Outputs**: Evolve according to mean field dynamics
- **Connection**: NTK is linearization of mean field

#### Edge of Chaos
