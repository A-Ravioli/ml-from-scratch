# Initialization Theory for Deep Neural Networks

## Prerequisites
- Linear algebra (eigenvalues, matrix norms)
- Probability theory (random variables, variance)
- Neural network fundamentals (forward/backward pass)
- Basic understanding of activation functions

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the vanishing and exploding gradient problems
- Master principled initialization schemes (Xavier/Glorot, He, etc.)
- Analyze signal propagation in deep networks
- Implement and compare different initialization methods
- Connect initialization to optimization and generalization

## Mathematical Foundations

### 1. The Initialization Problem

#### Why Initialization Matters
Poor initialization leads to:
1. **Vanishing gradients**: Gradients become exponentially small
2. **Exploding gradients**: Gradients become exponentially large
3. **Dead neurons**: Units that never activate
4. **Slow convergence**: Poor optimization dynamics
5. **Symmetry breaking**: Need to break symmetry between units

#### Historical Context
- **1980s**: Random small weights (often too small)
- **1990s**: Heuristic methods without theory
- **2010s**: Principled approaches based on signal propagation

### 2. Signal Propagation Analysis

#### Forward Pass Variance Analysis
Consider L-layer network with activations a^(ℓ):

**Layer computation**:
z^(ℓ) = W^(ℓ)a^(ℓ-1) + b^(ℓ)
a^(ℓ) = σ(z^(ℓ))

**Variance propagation**:
Var[z_i^(ℓ)] = ∑_j Var[W_{ij}^(ℓ)]Var[a_j^(ℓ-1)] + Var[b_i^(ℓ)]

#### Assumptions for Analysis
1. **Independence**: Weights, biases, and activations are independent
2. **Zero mean**: E[W_{ij}^(ℓ)] = 0, E[b_i^(ℓ)] = 0
3. **Identical distribution**: Within each layer, parameters have same distribution

#### Key Insight
For variance to remain constant across layers:
n^(ℓ-1) Var[W_{ij}^(ℓ)] = 1

where n^(ℓ-1) is the number of inputs to layer ℓ.

### 3. Xavier/Glorot Initialization

#### Derivation
**Goal**: Keep variance of activations and gradients consistent across layers.

#### Forward Pass Analysis
For linear activations (σ(x) = x):
Var[a^(ℓ)] = n^(ℓ-1) Var[W^(ℓ)] Var[a^(ℓ-1)]

For constant variance: n^(ℓ-1) Var[W^(ℓ)] = 1

#### Backward Pass Analysis
During backpropagation:
Var[∂L/∂a^(ℓ-1)] = n^(ℓ) Var[W^(ℓ)] Var[∂L/∂a^(ℓ)]

For constant gradient variance: n^(ℓ) Var[W^(ℓ)] = 1

#### Xavier Compromise
Since forward pass wants Var[W^(ℓ)] = 1/n^(ℓ-1) and backward pass wants Var[W^(ℓ)] = 1/n^(ℓ):

**Xavier initialization**:
Var[W^(ℓ)] = 2/(n^(ℓ-1) + n^(ℓ))

#### Practical Implementations
**Uniform distribution**:
W_{ij}^(ℓ) ~ U[-√(6/(n^(ℓ-1) + n^(ℓ))), √(6/(n^(ℓ-1) + n^(ℓ)))]

**Normal distribution**:
W_{ij}^(ℓ) ~ N(0, 2/(n^(ℓ-1) + n^(ℓ)))

### 4. He Initialization

#### Motivation
Xavier initialization assumes linear activations, but ReLU is widely used.

#### ReLU Analysis
For ReLU activation: σ(x) = max(0, x)
- **Mean**: E[σ(x)] = E[x]/2 (for zero-mean x)
- **Variance**: Var[σ(x)] = Var[x]/2

#### He Derivation
For ReLU networks, the effective variance is halved:
Var[a^(ℓ)] = (1/2) n^(ℓ-1) Var[W^(ℓ)] Var[a^(ℓ-1)]

For constant variance:
n^(ℓ-1) Var[W^(ℓ)] = 2

#### He Initialization Formula
**Normal distribution**:
W_{ij}^(ℓ) ~ N(0, 2/n^(ℓ-1))

**Uniform distribution**:
W_{ij}^(ℓ) ~ U[-√(6/n^(ℓ-1)), √(6/n^(ℓ-1))]

#### Theorem 4.1 (He et al. 2015)
For ReLU networks with He initialization, the variance of activations remains approximately constant across layers, enabling training of very deep networks.

### 5. Activation-Specific Initializations

#### Tanh Networks
For tanh activation: σ(x) = tanh(x)
- **Derivative at origin**: σ'(0) = 1
- **Effective variance**: ≈ Var[x] for small x

**Recommendation**: Use Xavier initialization

#### Sigmoid Networks  
For sigmoid activation: σ(x) = 1/(1 + e^(-x))
- **Derivative at origin**: σ'(0) = 1/4
- **Saturation**: Gradients vanish for large |x|

**Recommendation**: Use Xavier with careful scaling

#### Leaky ReLU
For Leaky ReLU: σ(x) = max(αx, x) where α ≪ 1
- **Effective variance**: Var[σ(x)] ≈ ((1 + α²)/2) Var[x]

**Modified He initialization**:
Var[W^(ℓ)] = 2/((1 + α²) n^(ℓ-1))

#### Swish/SiLU
For Swish: σ(x) = x/(1 + e^(-x))
- **Self-gating**: Combines linear and sigmoid properties
- **Initialization**: Similar to ReLU (He initialization works well)

### 6. Advanced Initialization Schemes

#### LSUV (Layer-wise Sequential Unit-Variance)
**Algorithm 6.1 (LSUV)**:
1. Initialize with orthogonal or He initialization
2. For each layer ℓ = 1, ..., L:
   - Forward pass a mini-batch
   - Compute variance of pre-activations
   - Scale weights to achieve unit variance
   - Optionally center activations

#### Fixup Initialization
**Motivation**: Initialize residual networks to behave like identity mappings initially.

**Method**:
- Initialize residual branches to output zero
- Scale by depth-dependent factors
- No normalization layers needed

#### LSUV+ and Modern Variants
- **Data-dependent**: Use actual training data statistics
- **Layer-adaptive**: Different schemes for different layer types
- **Architecture-aware**: Account for skip connections, attention

### 7. Theoretical Analysis

#### Dynamical Isometry
**Definition**: A network has dynamical isometry if:
1. **Forward**: ||a^(ℓ)||² ≈ ||a^(ℓ-1)||² (preserves norms)
2. **Backward**: ||∂L/∂a^(ℓ)||² ≈ ||∂L/∂a^(ℓ+1)||² (preserves gradient norms)

#### Theorem 7.1 (Dynamical Isometry Condition)
For ReLU networks, dynamical isometry requires:
- **Weight variance**: Var[W^(ℓ)] = 2/n^(ℓ-1)
- **Orthogonal weights**: W^(ℓ)(W^(ℓ))^T ≈ I

#### Edge of Chaos
Networks at the "edge of chaos" have:
- **Ordered phase**: All activations die out (underparameterized)
- **Chaotic phase**: Activations explode (overparameterized)  
- **Critical phase**: Balanced propagation (optimal)

**Critical line**: χ = 1 where χ is the Lyapunov exponent.

### 8. Empirical Guidelines

#### General Principles
1. **Zero mean**: Initialize weights with zero mean
2. **Appropriate variance**: Match activation function
3. **Break symmetry**: Avoid identical units
4. **Layer-wise**: Different initialization per layer type

#### Common Pitfalls
- **Too small weights**: Gradients vanish, slow learning
- **Too large weights**: Gradients explode, instability
- **Ignoring architecture**: Skip connections change requirements
- **Wrong activation**: ReLU needs different scaling than tanh

#### Architecture-Specific Recommendations

**Feedforward Networks**:
- ReLU: He initialization
- Tanh/Sigmoid: Xavier initialization
- Swish/GELU: He initialization

**Convolutional Networks**:
- Same as feedforward, scaled by kernel size
- Fan-in: n = kernel_size² × input_channels

**Recurrent Networks**:
- Hidden-to-hidden: Orthogonal initialization
- Input-to-hidden: Xavier/He initialization

**Residual Networks**:
- Main path: Standard initialization
- Residual path: Zero initialization or Fixup
- Skip connection scaling: 1/√L

**Transformer Networks**:
- Attention: Xavier with depth scaling
- Feedforward: He initialization
- Layer norm: Standard initialization

### 9. Batch Normalization and Initialization

#### Interaction with BatchNorm
Batch normalization reduces sensitivity to initialization:
- **Normalization**: Forces zero mean, unit variance
- **Scale and shift**: Learnable parameters γ, β
- **Reduced dependence**: Less critical initialization

#### Pre-LayerNorm vs Post-LayerNorm
**Pre-LayerNorm**: Apply normalization before main transformation
- More stable training
- Less sensitive to initialization

**Post-LayerNorm**: Apply normalization after main transformation  
- Original formulation
- May need careful initialization

### 10. Modern Considerations

#### Very Deep Networks (100+ layers)
- **Residual connections**: Essential for gradient flow
- **Dense connections**: DenseNet-style connections
- **Highway networks**: Learnable gating

#### Wide Networks
- **Neural Tangent Kernel regime**: Infinite width limit
- **Mean Field Theory**: Statistical physics approach
- **Feature learning**: Finite vs infinite width behavior

#### Efficient Networks (MobileNet, EfficientNet)
- **Depthwise separable**: Different fan-in calculations
- **Squeeze-and-excitation**: Channel attention scaling
- **Mixed precision**: FP16 considerations

### 11. Optimization Landscape Effects

#### Loss Surface Geometry
Good initialization leads to:
- **Smoother landscapes**: Fewer sharp minima
- **Better connectivity**: Paths between solutions
- **Faster convergence**: Closer to good solutions

#### Lottery Ticket Hypothesis
- **Winning tickets**: Subnetworks that train well
- **Initialization matters**: For finding these tickets
- **Magnitude vs signs**: Which aspects are crucial

### 12. Practical Implementation

def xavier_uniform(tensor, gain=1.0):
    """Xavier uniform initialization."""
    fan_in = tensor.size(1)
    fan_out = tensor.size(0)
    std = gain * sqrt(2.0 / (fan_in + fan_out))
    bound = sqrt(3.0) * std
    return tensor.uniform_(-bound, bound)

def he_normal(tensor):
    """He normal initialization for ReLU."""
    fan_in = tensor.size(1)
    std = sqrt(2.0 / fan_in)
    return tensor.normal_(0, std)
```
