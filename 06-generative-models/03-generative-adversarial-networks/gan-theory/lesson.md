## Mathematical Foundations

### 1. Original GAN Formulation

#### Definition 1.1 (GAN Objective)
The original GAN objective is a two-player minimax game:

min_G max_D V(D, G) = 𝔼_{x~p_{data}}[log D(x)] + 𝔼_{z~p_z}[log(1 - D(G(z)))]

where:
- G: Generator mapping noise z to data space
- D: Discriminator distinguishing real from fake data
- p_data: True data distribution  
- p_z: Noise distribution (typically Gaussian)

#### Game-Theoretic Interpretation
**Two players with opposing objectives**:
- **Discriminator**: Maximize ability to classify real vs fake
- **Generator**: Minimize discriminator's classification accuracy

**Nash Equilibrium**: Point where neither player can improve unilaterally

#### Optimal Discriminator
For fixed generator G, the optimal discriminator is:

D*_G(x) = p_data(x) / (p_data(x) + p_g(x))

where p_g is the distribution induced by the generator.

**Proof**: 
Taking functional derivative of V(D,G) w.r.t. D:
δV/δD = p_data(x)/D(x) - p_g(x)/(1-D(x)) = 0

Solving: D*(x) = p_data(x)/(p_data(x) + p_g(x))

### 2. Global Optimality Analysis

#### Theorem 2.1 (Global Optimum)
The global minimum of the GAN objective is achieved when p_g = p_data, and the minimum value is -log(4).

**Proof**:
Substituting optimal discriminator into objective:
C(G) = 𝔼_{x~p_{data}}[log(p_data(x)/(p_data(x) + p_g(x)))] + 𝔼_{x~p_g}[log(p_g(x)/(p_data(x) + p_g(x)))]

This can be rewritten as:
C(G) = -log(4) + 2·JSD(p_data || p_g)

where JSD is Jensen-Shannon divergence.

Since JSD ≥ 0 with equality iff p_data = p_g, the global minimum is -log(4).

#### Jensen-Shannon Divergence Connection
**Key insight**: GANs minimize Jensen-Shannon divergence between real and generated distributions.

JSD(p || q) = (1/2)KL(p || (p+q)/2) + (1/2)KL(q || (p+q)/2)

**Properties**:
- Symmetric: JSD(p || q) = JSD(q || p)
- Bounded: 0 ≤ JSD(p || q) ≤ log(2)
- Differentiable (unlike total variation distance)

### 3. Training Dynamics Analysis

#### Non-Convex-Concave Game
**Challenge**: GAN objective is non-convex in G and non-concave in (G,D) jointly.

**Implications**:
- Standard convex optimization theory doesn't apply
- No guarantee of convergence to global optimum
- Local Nash equilibria may exist

#### Simultaneous Gradient Descent
Standard training uses alternating gradient steps:
- D_{t+1} = D_t + η_D ∇_D V(D_t, G_t)  
- G_{t+1} = G_t - η_G ∇_G V(D_t, G_t)

#### Theorem 3.1 (Local Convergence)
Under certain regularity conditions, simultaneous gradient descent converges locally to Nash equilibria.

**Conditions** (simplified):
- Functions are twice continuously differentiable
- Hessian satisfies certain eigenvalue conditions
- Learning rates are sufficiently small

### 4. Mode Collapse Analysis

#### Definition 4.1 (Mode Collapse)
Mode collapse occurs when the generator produces limited variety of samples, failing to capture all modes of the data distribution.

#### Types of Mode Collapse
1. **Complete Collapse**: Generator produces identical samples
2. **Partial Collapse**: Generator misses some modes of data distribution  
3. **Mode Hopping**: Generator alternates between different modes during training

#### Theoretical Explanation
**Root cause**: Generator finds local minima that fool discriminator without covering full data distribution.

**Mathematical perspective**: 
- Generator minimizes reverse KL: KL(p_g || p_data)
- Reverse KL heavily penalizes p_g(x) > 0 when p_data(x) = 0
- This encourages mode-seeking behavior (concentrating on single modes)

#### Unrolled GANs Solution
**Idea**: Update generator considering multiple discriminator steps ahead.

Objective becomes:
min_G V(D_k(G), G)

where D_k(G) is discriminator after k optimization steps starting from current D.

### 5. Alternative GAN Formulations

#### Least Squares GAN (LSGAN)
Replace logistic loss with least squares:

L_D = (1/2)𝔼_{x~p_data}[(D(x) - 1)²] + (1/2)𝔼_{z~p_z}[(D(G(z)))²]
L_G = (1/2)𝔼_{z~p_z}[(D(G(z)) - 1)²]

**Benefits**:
- More stable training
- Better gradient behavior
- Minimizes Pearson χ² divergence

#### Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)
**Motivation**: Address vanishing gradients and mode collapse

**Earth Mover's Distance**: 
W(p_r, p_g) = inf_{γ ∈ Π(p_r, p_g)} 𝔼_{(x,y)~γ}[||x - y||]

**WGAN Objective**:
min_G max_{D ∈ 1-Lipschitz} 𝔼_{x~p_r}[D(x)] - 𝔼_{z~p_z}[D(G(z))]

**Kantorovich-Rubinstein Theorem**: Under Lipschitz constraint,
W(p_r, p_g) = sup_{||f||_L ≤ 1} 𝔼_{x~p_r}[f(x)] - 𝔼_{y~p_g}[f(y)]

#### WGAN-GP (Gradient Penalty)
**Problem**: Weight clipping in WGAN causes training issues
**Solution**: Gradient penalty on interpolated samples

GP = λ𝔼_{x̂~p_{x̂}}[(||∇_{x̂} D(x̂)||₂ - 1)²]

where x̂ = εx + (1-ε)G(z) with ε ~ Uniform[0,1].

### 6. Information-Theoretic Analysis

#### Mutual Information Perspective
**InfoGAN**: Maximize mutual information between generated data and latent codes

L_InfoGAN = L_GAN - λI(c; G(z,c))

where c are structured latent codes.

**Variational bound**:
I(c; G(z,c)) ≥ 𝔼_{c~p(c),x~G(z,c)}[log Q(c|x)] + H(c)

#### Feature Matching
**Objective**: Match statistics of real and generated data
L_FM = ||𝔼_{x~p_data}[f(x)] - 𝔼_{z~p_z}[f(G(z))]||²₂

where f(·) are features from intermediate layers of discriminator.

### 7. Spectral Analysis of Training Dynamics

#### Jacobian Analysis
Consider the game vector field:
v(θ) = [∇_θ_G L_G(θ_G, θ_D), -∇_θ_D L_D(θ_G, θ_D)]

**Jacobian**: J = ∇v(θ)

**Eigenvalue analysis**:
- Real parts < 0: Local stability
- Real parts > 0: Instability  
- Complex eigenvalues: Oscillatory dynamics

#### Spectral Normalization
**Motivation**: Control Lipschitz constant of discriminator

**Method**: Normalize weight matrices by largest singular value
W_SN = W / σ(W)

**Benefits**:
- Improved training stability
- Better gradient flow
- Theoretical guarantees on discriminator regularity

### 8. Convergence Theory

#### Definition 8.1 (Different Convergence Notions)
1. **Pointwise convergence**: θ_t → θ*
2. **Distributional convergence**: p_g^t → p_data
3. **Nash convergence**: No player can improve unilaterally

#### Local Convergence Results
**Theorem 8.1**: Under certain conditions on the Jacobian eigenvalues, GAN training exhibits local linear convergence to Nash equilibria.

**Conditions**: 
- Jacobian has negative real parts for all eigenvalues
- Functions satisfy smoothness conditions
- Learning rates are appropriately chosen

#### Global Convergence Challenges
**Non-convexity**: No general global convergence guarantees
**Empirical observations**: Many GANs converge in practice despite lack of theory

### 9. Generalization Theory

#### Definition 9.1 (Generalization in GANs)
A GAN generalizes well if p_g approximates p_data even on unseen data from the same distribution.

#### Sample Complexity
**Question**: How many samples needed for GAN to learn distribution?

**Theoretical results** (simplified):
- Sample complexity depends on:
  - Complexity of generator class
  - Discriminator class  
  - Target distribution properties
  - Desired approximation accuracy

#### Overfitting in GANs
**Memorization vs Generation**:
- **Bad**: Generator memorizes training samples
- **Good**: Generator learns underlying distribution

**Metrics**:
- Inception Score (IS)
- Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)
- Precision and Recall

### 10. Mode Collapse Solutions

#### Theoretical Approaches

**Unrolled GANs**: 
- Consider future discriminator updates
- Reduces myopic generator behavior

**VEEGAN (Variational Encoder Enhancement)**:
- Add reconstruction loss in latent space
- Ensures invertibility of generator

**Mathematical formulation**:
L_VEEGAN = L_GAN + λ𝔼_{z~p_z}[||z - E(G(z))||²₂]

#### Mini-batch Discrimination
**Idea**: Let discriminator see multiple samples simultaneously

**Implementation**: Concatenate features from other samples in mini-batch before final discriminator layer.

#### Historical Averaging
**Regularization term**: 
L_historical = ||θ - (1/t)∑_{i=1}^t θ_i||²₂

Encourages parameters to stay close to historical average.

### 11. Advanced Theoretical Topics

#### Optimal Transport Connections
**Wasserstein distance** is special case of optimal transport cost:
W_c(μ,ν) = inf_{γ ∈ Π(μ,ν)} ∫c(x,y)dγ(x,y)

**Connection to GANs**: Many GAN variants implicitly minimize transport costs between distributions.

#### Information Geometry
**Fisher Information Metric**: Natural Riemannian metric on probability distributions
**Connection**: GAN training can be viewed as gradient flow on manifold of distributions

#### Measure Theory Foundations
**Radon-Nikodym Theorem**: Conditions under which one measure has density w.r.t. another
**Relevance**: Discriminator approximates density ratio dp_data/dp_g

### 12. Non-Asymptotic Analysis

#### Finite Sample Theory
**Question**: How well do finite-sample GANs approximate target distribution?

**Generalization bounds**:
W(p̂_g, p_data) ≤ W(p_g, p_data) + O(√(log(n)/n))

where p̂_g is empirical generator distribution from n samples.

#### Learning Theory Perspective
**PAC-Bayes bounds**: Probability that generated distribution is close to target
**Rademacher complexity**: Measure of richness of generator class

### 13. Connections to Other Generative Models

#### VAE vs GAN Comparison
**VAE objective**: ELBO = 𝔼[log p(x|z)] - KL(q(z|x) || p(z))
**GAN objective**: Adversarial game

**Theoretical differences**:
- VAE: Explicit likelihood, mode covering (forward KL)
- GAN: Implicit likelihood, mode seeking (reverse KL)

#### Normalizing Flow Connections
**Bijective generators**: If G is invertible, can compute exact likelihood
**Volume preservation**: |det(∂G/∂z)| appears in likelihood

#### Diffusion Model Relations
**Score-based perspective**: Both learn score function ∇_x log p(x)
**Adversarial score matching**: Use discriminator to estimate scores
