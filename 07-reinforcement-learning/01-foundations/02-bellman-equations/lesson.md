## Mathematical Foundations

### 1. Bellman Operators

#### Definition 1.1 (Bellman Expectation Operator)
For a given policy π, the Bellman expectation operator T^π : ℝ^|S| → ℝ^|S| is defined as:
(T^π V)(s) = ∑_a π(a|s) ∑_{s'} P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + γV(s')]

#### Definition 1.2 (Bellman Optimality Operator)
The Bellman optimality operator T* : ℝ^|S| → ℝ^|S| is defined as:
(T* V)(s) = max_a ∑_{s'} P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + γV(s')]

#### Matrix Representation
For finite state spaces, T^π can be written as:
T^π V = R^π + γP^π V

where:
- R^π ∈ ℝ^|S|: Expected immediate rewards under π
- P^π ∈ ℝ^|S|×|S|: Transition probability matrix under π

### 2. Contraction Properties

#### Definition 2.1 (Contraction Mapping)
An operator T : X → X on metric space (X, d) is a contraction if there exists λ ∈ [0,1) such that:
d(Tx, Ty) ≤ λ d(x, y) for all x, y ∈ X

#### Theorem 2.1 (T^π is a Contraction)
The Bellman expectation operator T^π is a contraction mapping in the supremum norm with contraction factor γ.

**Proof**:
For any V, U ∈ ℝ^|S|:
|(T^π V)(s) - (T^π U)(s)| 
= |∑_a π(a|s) ∑_{s'} P(s'|s,a) γ[V(s') - U(s')]|
≤ ∑_a π(a|s) ∑_{s'} P(s'|s,a) γ|V(s') - U(s')|
≤ γ ||V - U||_∞ ∑_a π(a|s) ∑_{s'} P(s'|s,a)
= γ ||V - U||_∞

Therefore ||T^π V - T^π U||_∞ ≤ γ ||V - U||_∞ □

#### Theorem 2.2 (T* is a Contraction)
The Bellman optimality operator T* is a contraction mapping with contraction factor γ.

**Proof**: 
For any V, U ∈ ℝ^|S|:
|(T* V)(s) - (T* U)(s)|
= |max_a ∑_{s'} P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + γV(s')] - max_a ∑_{s'} P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + γU(s')]|
≤ max_a |∑_{s'} P(s'|s,a) γ[V(s') - U(s')]|
≤ γ ||V - U||_∞

Therefore ||T* V - T* U||_∞ ≤ γ ||V - U||_∞ □

### 3. Banach Fixed Point Theorem

#### Theorem 3.1 (Banach Fixed Point Theorem)
Let (X, d) be a complete metric space and T : X → X be a contraction mapping with contraction factor λ < 1. Then:
1. T has a unique fixed point x* ∈ X
2. For any x_0 ∈ X, the sequence x_{n+1} = T(x_n) converges to x*
3. The convergence rate is: d(x_n, x*) ≤ λ^n d(x_0, x*)

#### Corollary 3.1 (Bellman Equation Solutions)
1. The Bellman expectation equation V^π = T^π V^π has a unique solution
2. The Bellman optimality equation V* = T* V* has a unique solution
3. Value iteration V_{k+1} = T* V_k converges to V* at rate γ^k

### 4. Existence and Uniqueness Results

#### Theorem 4.1 (Existence of V^π)
For any policy π and discount factor γ ∈ [0,1), there exists a unique solution V^π to the Bellman expectation equation.

**Proof**: 
The space of bounded functions on S with supremum norm is complete. T^π is a contraction with factor γ < 1. By Banach fixed point theorem, unique fixed point exists. □

#### Theorem 4.2 (Existence of V*)
For discount factor γ ∈ [0,1), there exists a unique optimal value function V*.

#### Theorem 4.3 (Optimality of Greedy Policy)
If π is greedy with respect to V*:
π(s) ∈ argmax_a ∑_{s'} P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + γV*(s')]

Then π is optimal: V^π = V*.

**Proof**:
V* = T* V* ≥ T^π V* (since π is greedy)
But V^π is the unique fixed point of T^π, so V^π ≤ V*
Since V* is optimal, V^π = V* □

### 5. Convergence Rates and Error Bounds

#### Linear Convergence of Value Iteration
**Theorem 5.1**: Value iteration converges linearly:
||V_k - V*||_∞ ≤ γ^k ||V_0 - V*||_∞

#### Policy Evaluation Convergence
**Theorem 5.2**: Iterative policy evaluation converges:
||V_k^π - V^π||_∞ ≤ γ^k ||V_0 - V^π||_∞

#### Finite Sample Approximation Error
**Theorem 5.3**: If we approximate T* with T̂* (e.g., due to sampling), and ||T̂* V - T* V||_∞ ≤ ε for all V, then:
||V̂* - V*||_∞ ≤ ε/(1-γ)

where V̂* is the fixed point of T̂*.

### 6. Computational Aspects

#### Direct Solution (Small State Spaces)
For finite MDPs, V^π = (I - γP^π)^{-1}R^π

**Computational cost**: O(|S|³) for matrix inversion

#### Iterative Methods
**Value Iteration**: V_{k+1} = T* V_k
**Policy Evaluation**: V_{k+1} = T^π V_k

**Computational cost per iteration**: O(|S|²|A|)

#### Stopping Criteria
**ε-optimal policy**: Stop when ||V_{k+1} - V_k||_∞ < ε(1-γ)/(2γ)

**Theorem 6.1**: If stopping criterion is met, then:
||V_k - V*||_∞ ≤ ε/(1-γ)

### 7. Asynchronous Dynamic Programming

#### Gauss-Seidel Value Iteration
Update states in arbitrary order, using most recent values:
V(s) ← max_a ∑_{s'} P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + γV(s')]

#### Theorem 7.1 (Asynchronous Convergence)
If every state is updated infinitely often, asynchronous value iteration converges to V*.

#### Priority Sweeping
Update states in order of Bellman error magnitude:
Priority(s) = |max_a ∑_{s'} P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + γV(s')] - V(s)|

### 8. Function Approximation and Bellman Equations

#### Approximate Value Iteration
When state space is large, approximate: V(s) ≈ V̂(s; θ)

**Projected Bellman Operator**: T̂^π V = Π T^π V
where Π is projection onto function approximation space.

#### Theorem 8.1 (Approximation Error Bound)
If T̂^π is a contraction with factor γ̃, then:
||V̂^π - V^π||_∞ ≤ (1/(1-γ̃)) inf_{θ} ||V^π - V̂(·; θ)||_∞

#### Least Squares Policy Evaluation
**LSTD**: Solve Φθ = Π T^π Φθ where Φ is feature matrix

**Normal equations**: A θ = b
- A = Φ^T(Φ - γP^π Φ)  
- b = Φ^T R^π

### 9. Average Reward MDPs

#### Average Reward Bellman Equation
h(s) + ρ = max_a ∑_{s'} P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + h(s')]

where ρ is the average reward and h(s) is the differential value.

#### Theorem 9.1 (Average Reward Optimality)
For finite, irreducible, aperiodic MDPs, there exists optimal ρ* and h* satisfying the average reward Bellman equation.

#### Relative Value Iteration
h_{k+1}(s) = max_a ∑_{s'} P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + h_k(s')] - h_k(s_0)

### 10. Minimax and Risk-Sensitive Bellman Equations

#### Minimax MDPs
For robust control under model uncertainty:
V(s) = max_a min_{P' ∈ U(P)} ∑_{s'} P'(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + γV(s')]

where U(P) is uncertainty set around nominal model P.

#### Risk-Sensitive MDPs
**Exponential utility**: 
V(s) = max_a ∑_{s'} P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + γ log E[exp(V(s')/γ)]]

#### Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)
**CVaR Bellman equation**:
V_α(s) = max_a ∑_{s'} P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + γ CVaR_α(V(s'))]

### 11. Computational Linear Algebra Perspective

#### Spectral Analysis
For T^π = R^π + γP^π:
- Eigenvalues of P^π determine convergence
- Spectral radius ρ(γP^π) = γρ(P^π) ≤ γ < 1

#### Condition Number Analysis
**Condition number**: κ = ||(I - γP^π)^{-1}|| ||(I - γP^π)||

**Theorem 11.1**: For stochastic P^π:
κ ≤ (1+γ)/(1-γ)

#### Preconditioning
Use preconditioner M ≈ (I - γP^π):
M^{-1}(I - γP^π)V = M^{-1}R^π
