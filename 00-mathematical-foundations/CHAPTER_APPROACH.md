## Study Recommendations

### Daily Routine
- **Morning (2-3 hours)**: Pure theory - definitions, theorems, proofs
- **Afternoon (1-2 hours)**: Implementation exercises and computational work
- **Evening (30 minutes)**: Review and connection-making

### Weekly Goals
- **Week 1-2**: Analysis foundations, convergence concepts
- **Week 3-4**: Linear algebra, matrix decompositions, spectral theory
- **Week 5-6**: Probability theory, measure theory, stochastic processes
- **Week 7-8**: Optimization theory, convex analysis
- **Week 9-10**: Information geometry (optional), integration and review

### Assessment Strategy
1. **Theoretical Mastery**: Can you state and prove key theorems?
2. **Computational Fluency**: Can you implement algorithms from mathematical descriptions?
3. **Application Understanding**: Can you identify where these concepts appear in ML?
4. **Problem Solving**: Can you adapt techniques to new situations?

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### 1. Rushing Through Proofs
**Problem**: Skipping proof details or accepting results without understanding
**Solution**: Work through every step, reconstruct proofs from memory

### 2. Ignoring Computational Aspects
**Problem**: Focusing only on theory without implementation
**Solution**: Always complete the coding exercises - they build essential intuition

### 3. Not Connecting to Applications
**Problem**: Learning math in isolation from ML applications
**Solution**: Regularly ask "Where will I use this in machine learning?"

### 4. Perfectionism Paralysis
**Problem**: Getting stuck on one concept and not progressing
**Solution**: Mark difficult concepts for later review, maintain forward momentum
