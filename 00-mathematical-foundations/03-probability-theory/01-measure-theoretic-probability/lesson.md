## Mathematical Foundations

### 1. Probability Spaces

#### Definition 1.1 (σ-algebra)
A σ-algebra (or σ-field) F on a set Ω is a collection of subsets satisfying:
1. Ω ∈ F
2. If A ∈ F, then A^c ∈ F (closed under complement)
3. If {Aᵢ}ᵢ₌₁^∞ ⊂ F, then ∪ᵢ₌₁^∞ Aᵢ ∈ F (closed under countable union)

#### Definition 1.2 (Probability Space)
A probability space is a triple (Ω, F, P) where:
- Ω is the sample space (all possible outcomes)
- F is a σ-algebra on Ω (measurable events)
- P: F → [0,1] is a probability measure satisfying:
  1. P(Ω) = 1
  2. P(A) ≥ 0 for all A ∈ F
  3. For disjoint {Aᵢ}, P(∪ᵢAᵢ) = Σᵢ P(Aᵢ) (countable additivity)

#### ML Examples
- **Classification**: Ω = {class labels}, F = 2^Ω, P = class distribution
- **Regression**: Ω = ℝ, F = Borel σ-algebra, P = target distribution
- **RL**: Ω = state space, F = measurable sets, P = state visitation

### 2. Random Variables and Measurability

#### Definition 2.1 (Random Variable)
A random variable is a measurable function X: Ω → ℝ, meaning:
For all Borel sets B ⊆ ℝ, X⁻¹(B) = {ω ∈ Ω : X(ω) ∈ B} ∈ F

#### Definition 2.2 (Distribution)
The distribution of X is the pushforward measure:
P_X(B) = P(X⁻¹(B)) = P(X ∈ B)

#### Theorem 2.1 (Measurability and Operations)
If X, Y are random variables and f: ℝ² → ℝ is Borel measurable, then f(X,Y) is a random variable.

**Proof**: The composition of measurable functions is measurable. □

### 3. Integration and Expectation

#### Definition 3.1 (Expectation)
For a random variable X, the expectation is:
E[X] = ∫_Ω X(ω) dP(ω) = ∫_ℝ x dP_X(x)

This is the Lebesgue integral with respect to P.

#### Construction of the Integral
1. **Simple functions**: X = Σᵢ aᵢ 1_{Aᵢ}, then E[X] = Σᵢ aᵢ P(Aᵢ)
2. **Non-negative**: X ≥ 0, approximate by simple functions
3. **General**: X = X⁺ - X⁻ where X⁺ = max(X,0), X⁻ = max(-X,0)

#### Theorem 3.1 (Monotone Convergence)
If 0 ≤ X₁ ≤ X₂ ≤ ... and Xₙ → X pointwise, then:
lim_{n→∞} E[Xₙ] = E[X]

#### Theorem 3.2 (Dominated Convergence)
If Xₙ → X pointwise and |Xₙ| ≤ Y with E[Y] < ∞, then:
lim_{n→∞} E[Xₙ] = E[X]

### 4. Independence and Conditional Expectation

#### Definition 4.1 (Independence)
Events A, B are independent if P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B).
Random variables X, Y are independent if for all Borel sets A, B:
P(X ∈ A, Y ∈ B) = P(X ∈ A)P(Y ∈ B)

#### Definition 4.2 (Conditional Expectation)
Given a sub-σ-algebra G ⊆ F, the conditional expectation E[X|G] is the unique G-measurable random variable satisfying:
∫_G E[X|G] dP = ∫_G X dP for all G ∈ G

#### Properties
1. E[E[X|G]] = E[X] (tower property)
2. If X is G-measurable, E[X|G] = X
3. If X ⊥ G, then E[X|G] = E[X]

### 5. Convergence Concepts

#### Definition 5.1 (Modes of Convergence)
1. **Almost sure**: P(lim_{n→∞} Xₙ = X) = 1
2. **In probability**: ∀ε > 0, lim_{n→∞} P(|Xₙ - X| > ε) = 0
3. **In L^p**: lim_{n→∞} E[|Xₙ - X|^p] = 0
4. **In distribution**: lim_{n→∞} F_{Xₙ}(x) = F_X(x) at continuity points

#### Relationships
- Almost sure ⟹ In probability ⟹ In distribution
- L^p convergence ⟹ In probability
- Neither implies the other between a.s. and L^p

### 6. Characteristic Functions and Moments

#### Definition 6.1 (Characteristic Function)
φ_X(t) = E[e^{itX}] = ∫ e^{itx} dP_X(x)

#### Properties
1. φ_X(0) = 1
2. |φ_X(t)| ≤ 1
3. φ_X uniquely determines the distribution
4. φ_{X+Y}(t) = φ_X(t)φ_Y(t) if X ⊥ Y

#### Theorem 6.1 (Lévy's Continuity Theorem)
Xₙ →^d X if and only if φ_{Xₙ}(t) → φ_X(t) for all t.

### 7. Concentration Inequalities

#### Theorem 7.1 (Markov's Inequality)
For X ≥ 0 and a > 0:
P(X ≥ a) ≤ E[X]/a

**Proof**: 
P(X ≥ a) = E[1_{X≥a}] ≤ E[X/a · 1_{X≥a}] ≤ E[X]/a □

#### Theorem 7.2 (Chebyshev's Inequality)
P(|X - E[X]| ≥ a) ≤ Var(X)/a²

#### Theorem 7.3 (Chernoff Bound)
For any t > 0:
P(X ≥ a) ≤ inf_{t>0} e^{-ta} E[e^{tX}]

#### Theorem 7.4 (Hoeffding's Inequality)
If X₁, ..., Xₙ are independent with Xᵢ ∈ [aᵢ, bᵢ], then:
P(|∑(Xᵢ - E[Xᵢ])/n| ≥ ε) ≤ 2exp(-2n²ε²/∑(bᵢ - aᵢ)²)

### 8. Probability on Function Spaces

#### Definition 8.1 (Gaussian Process)
A Gaussian process is a collection {X_t}_{t∈T} such that for any finite subset {t₁, ..., tₙ} ⊂ T, (X_{t₁}, ..., X_{tₙ}) is multivariate Gaussian.

Characterized by:
- Mean function: m(t) = E[X_t]
- Covariance function: k(s,t) = Cov(X_s, X_t)

#### ML Connection
- Gaussian processes for regression
- Neural network initialization theory
- Kernel methods as covariance functions
